Assignment 1

Create a class named Triangle, the class must contain:

• Private data fields base and height with setter and getter methods.

• A constructor that sets the values of base and height.

• A method named area() that calculates and returns the area of the triangle.


Create a class named TestTriangle to test the Triangle class. 

The TestTriangle class must contain the main method.

In the main method, create one object from the Triangle class (base = 7.5, and height = 12.3). Then, print the area of the triangle
object.

Note: Please save your code (for both the Triangle and TestTriangle classes) in a
.txt document and submit the .txt document through CANVAS.
